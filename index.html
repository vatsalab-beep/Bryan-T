        <h1> I'm a freelance photographer and videographer based in New Jersey, USA.</h1>

        <p> I started photography and videography as a hobby in June 2019.
        As I learned and grew as a creator, that quickly led to commissions from friends at a local small business.   
        I love capturing a feeling and telling more about a subject through photo and video. </p>
